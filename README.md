Below is a simplified example of Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture code snippet in Python without comments:

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None

    def get_data(self):
        return self.data

    def set_data(self, data):
        self.data = data


class View:
    def display_data(self, data):
        print("Displaying data:", data)


class Presenter:
    def __init__(self, model, view):
        self.model = model
        self.view = view

    def update_view(self):
        data = self.model.get_data()
        self.view.display_data(data)

    def set_model_data(self, data):
        self.model.set_data(data)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = Model()
    view = View()
    presenter = Presenter(model, view)

    # Update model data
    presenter.set_model_data("New data")

    # Update view
    presenter.update_view()
```

In this code:

- `Model` represents the data and business logic.
- `View` represents the UI components and their display logic.
- `Presenter` acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It retrieves data from the model and updates the view accordingly.
- Example usage demonstrates how to use the MVP architecture to update the model data and display it in the view.

This is a basic example, and you can extend it to include more complex logic and interactions between the model, view, and presenter as needed in your application.
