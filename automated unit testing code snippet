Below is a simplified example of automated unit testing code snippet in Python without comments:

```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

In this code:

- We define a function `add` that performs addition.
- We define a test case class `TestMathFunctions` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
- Inside the test case class, we define a test method `test_add` to test the `add` function.
- We use various assertion methods provided by the `unittest.TestCase` class, such as `assertEqual`, to verify the behavior of the `add` function.
- Finally, we use `unittest.main()` to run the test case.

This is a basic example of how to write automated unit tests using the `unittest` framework in Python. You can extend it to include more test cases and assertions as needed to thoroughly test your code.
